# Component Name

RealtorRecommendationMonitor

# Description

The RealtorRecommendationMonitor component is a Yeager Workflow building block designed to process user configurations and return message information. It inherits from the AbstractWorkflow base class and implements the `transform()` method to process input data (UserConfigurations) and return output data (MessageInfo).

# Input and Output Models

## Input Model

- UserConfigurations: A Pydantic BaseModel class that contains the following fields:
  - facebook_api_credentials: A dictionary containing the user's Facebook API credentials.
  - targeted_facebook_groups: A list of targeted Facebook groups.
  - messaging_platform_credentials: A dictionary containing the user's messaging platform credentials.
  - melissa_api_credentials: A dictionary containing the user's Melissa API credentials.

## Output Model

- MessageInfo: A Pydantic BaseModel class containing the following fields:
  - name: A string representing the name of the person.
  - phone_number: A string representing the phone number of the person.

Both input and output models leverage Pydantic for data validation, serialization, and deserialization.

# Parameters

- args: The `UserConfigurations` object containing the input data.
- callbacks: Optional. A parameter of `typing.Any` type. Default value: None.

# Transform Function

The `transform()` method performs the following steps:

1. Invoke the base class `transform()` method with the `args` and `callbacks` parameters, and store the result in `results_dict`.
2. Extract the `name` and `phone_number` fields from `results_dict`.
3. Create and return a `MessageInfo` object with the extracted `name` and `phone_number` fields.

# External Dependencies

The following external libraries are used in the RealtorRecommendationMonitor component:

- `typing`: For type hinting and annotations.
- `dotenv`: To load the environment variables.
- `fastapi`: For building the FastAPI application.
- `pydantic`: For input and output data validation and serialization.

# API Calls

The component does not directly call any external APIs. However, it processes user configurations containing API credentials, which might be used by other components or resources within the Yeager Workflow.

# Error Handling

Error handling for this component relies on the abstract class `AbstractWorkflow` and Pydantic for input validation. Specific exceptions and error messages are not explicitly handled within the component code.

# Examples

To use the RealtorRecommendationMonitor component within a Yeager Workflow, set up the necessary input data as follows:
