# 1. Component Name

StoreCredentials

## 2. Description

The `StoreCredentials` component is a Yeager Workflow component responsible for storing user credentials in a browser plugin's local storage.

## 3. Input and Output Models

This component uses two data models: `UserConfigurations` and `StoredCredentials`.

### UserConfigurations

* `credentials`: A dictionary containing the user's credentials.

### StoredCredentials

* `confirmation`: A string, serving as a confirmation message indicating that the user's credentials have been saved.

## 4. Parameters

* `localStorageKey`: A string representing the key under which user credentials will be stored in the local storage.

## 5. Transform Function

The `transform()` method of the `StoreCredentials` component follows these steps:

1. Retrieve the `localStorageKey` from the component configuration.
2. Convert the user credentials, provided as a dictionary, into a JSON string.
3. Call the `store_in_local_storage()` function to store the JSON-formatted credentials using the given `localStorageKey`. Note: The actual implementation of this function should be replaced with the correct implementation of storing data in the browser plugin's local storage.
4. Create and return a `StoredCredentials` object containing a confirmation message.

## 6. External Dependencies

* `os`: Retrieve environment variables and interact with the filesystem.
* `json`: Serialize data to and from JSON format.
* `yaml`: Parse YAML configuration files.
* `fastapi`: Build the FastAPI instance for the component.
* `dotenv`: Load environment variables from a `.env` file.
* `pydantic`: Define and validate input and output data models.

## 7. API Calls

There are no external API calls in this component.

## 8. Error Handling

Error handling occurs implicitly through the use of pydantic and FastAPI. If any input data does not conform to the required data models, an appropriate error response will be generated automatically by FastAPI.

## 9. Examples

### Example 1

Assuming we have a Yeager Workflow setup, we would include the StoreCredentials component as follows:

1. Configure the `localStorageKey` parameter in the component's YAML configuration file.
2. In the Workflow, include the FastAPI instance of the StoreCredentials component by calling the `transform()` method, as shown in the provided code snippet:
